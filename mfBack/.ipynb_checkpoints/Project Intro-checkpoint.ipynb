    "\n",
    "### **3. Data Preprocessing**\n",
    "- **Handling Missing Data:** Use interpolation, forward-fill, or machine learning imputation.\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features like moving averages, volatility, RSI, sentiment scores.\n",
    "- **Normalization:** Scale data for better ML performance.\n",
    "- **Time-Series Formatting:** Convert data into sequences for LSTM, transformers, or other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Machine Learning Models**\n",
    "#### **a) Traditional Models**\n",
    "- **ARIMA/SARIMA:** Basic statistical forecasting.\n",
    "- **Random Forest/XGBoost:** Feature-based predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **b) Deep Learning Models**\n",
    "- **LSTMs & GRUs:** Best for sequential financial data.\n",
    "- **Transformers (e.g., Time Series BERT):** Captures long-term dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **c) NLP Models for News & Social Media**\n",
    "- **TF-IDF + Sentiment Analysis:** To quantify textual data.\n",
    "- **BERT/FinBERT:** Extract insights from financial text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **d) Hybrid Models**\n",
    "- Combine LSTM for numerical data + BERT for news data.\n",
    "- Ensemble model using voting or stacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Model Training & Evaluation**\n",
    "- **Train on historical data (1980–2015), validate on 2016–2020, test on 2021–2024.**\n",
    "- **Metrics:** RMSE, MAE, MAPE, accuracy for trends.\n",
    "- **Backtesting:** Evaluate models on real-world trading scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Deployment**\n",
    "- **Backend:** Flask/Django for API.\n",
    "- **Frontend:** Angular/React for visualization.\n",
    "- **Database:** MongoDB/PostgreSQL to store historical & news data.\n",
    "- **Cloud:** AWS/GCP for scalable training & inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Continuous Learning & Model Updating**\n",
    "- **Pipeline:** Automate data scraping & model retraining.\n",
    "- **Feedback Loop:** Improve model accuracy over time.\n",
